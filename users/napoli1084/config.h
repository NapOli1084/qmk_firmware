// Otherwise shift isn't applied to the right keystroke and doesn't give the desired result.
// 3 milliseconds seems enough (it worked well with 5 and 10 also).
// More than 3 milliseconds slows down repetition with WinCompose unicode keys
// since they end up tapping 7-11 keys and repetition is every 33ms.

// (z becomes ctrl when you hold it, and when this option isn't enabled,
// z rapidly followed by x actually sends Ctrl-x. That's bad.)
